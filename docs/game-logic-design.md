## Overview

- **Genre:** Strategy Board Game / Itinerary Simulation
- **Objective:** Optimise Victory Points (VP) through resource management and schedule arrangement on a 5×5 grid board.
- **Unique value:** The final board layout is a real, feasible travel itinerary. *Play to Plan.*

## Board

A 5×5 grid: **5 days × 5 time slots** = 25 cells.

| | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Early Morning** | | | | | |
| **Morning** | | | | | |
| **Afternoon** | | | | | |
| **Evening** | | | | | |
| **Night** | | | | | |

Time slots represent a natural travel-day progression:
1. `early_morning` — dawn / breakfast / early start
2. `morning` — main morning activity
3. `afternoon` — post-lunch activity
4. `evening` — dinner / sunset
5. `night` — nightlife / late

## Game Phases

A game proceeds through 5 days. Each day has 2 interactive phases followed by an automatic end-of-day phase.

### Phase 1: Daily Drafting (5 rounds)

Each player receives **7 cards**. A clockwise passing draft runs for 5 rounds. In each round the player picks 1 card and passes the rest, until only 2 cards remain — those are discarded.

1. **Pick 1:** Hold 7 cards. Choose 1, place it face-down. Pass remaining 6.
2. **Pick 2:** Receive 6 cards. Choose 1. Pass remaining 5.
3. **Pick 3:** Receive 5 cards. Choose 1. Pass remaining 4.
4. **Pick 4:** Receive 4 cards. Choose 1. Pass remaining 3.
5. **Pick 5:** Receive 3 cards. Choose 1. Discard remaining 2.

After 5 rounds each player has built a 5-card hand for the day. The last 2 cards are discarded as filler.

Three options when picking a card:

| If | Mechanism | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Enough Xu & Stamina** | Pay normally | Card added to storage |
| **Short on Xu** | Borrow (Debt Token) | Card added; Debt Token in inventory (not counted toward storage limit) |
| **Short on Stamina** | Overexert | Card added; system randomly **locks** 1 time slot the next day |
| **Want to discard** | Dump for resources | Gain +1 Xu or +1 Stamina; slot left empty (acts as travel time — breaks distance chain) |

### Phase 2: Planning (Placement)

Drag & drop cards from storage onto the 5 time slots of the current day. Empty slots are allowed and function as travel/rest time.

### Phase 3: End of Day

- Cards remaining in storage are discarded.
- Advance to the next day. On Day 5, proceed directly to Simulation.

## Scoring — 5-Step Simulation

Run once after Day 5 (or as configured per campaign phase):

### Step 1: Debt Scan
Each leftover Debt Token deducts **3 VP**.

### Step 2: Random Events (15% chance per outdoor card)
For each non-INDOOR card on the board, roll a deterministic check (15% activation).
- **Weather event:** triggers VP penalty or bonus based on card tags.
- **Risky tags** (OUTDOOR, ACTION): penalty of 3 VP.
- **Safe tags**: penalty of 1 VP.
- INDOOR cards are immune.

### Step 3: Combo Scan
Scan the board along **two axes**:
- **Horizontal:** Adjacent slots within the same day.
- **Vertical:** Same slot position across consecutive days.
For each pair sharing a **common tag**, award **2 VP per shared tag**.

### Step 4: Distance Scan
Scan the board in chronological order (Day 1 early_morning → Day 1 morning → ... → Day 5 night).
- Use the **Haversine formula** to compute distance between consecutive cards (same day only).
- Penalty: **–2 VP** if distance > 20 km.
- **Empty slots break the distance chain** — cards before and after are not compared.
- Virtual cards (`is_virtual = true`) are skipped.

### Step 5: Final Tally
```
Total VP = Base VP (sum of card base_vp)
         + Combo VP
         - Debt Penalty
         - Distance Penalty
         - Event Penalty
```

### Export
The game ends with a **Timeline Report**: ordered list of placed cards with coordinates, estimated cost, and notes — ready to use as a real travel plan.

## Campaign Structure

The game is divided into **Phases**, each corresponding to a geographic region with its own card pool.

| Phase | Region | Days | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Sài Gòn (Saigon) | 5 days | The starting region |
| Phase 2+ | Da Lat / Da Nang / ... | 5 days per phase | Unlocked after completing Phase 1 |

After completing Phase 1 (Day 5), players choose which region to unlock for Phase 2.

### Tags

**4 Core Tags** (strategy / combo):

Key card sets defined in the design doc:

- **Tier 1 Street Food** (1 Xu, VP 5–8, mostly OUTDOOR)
- **Tier 2 Specialties** (2 Xu, VP 10–15, mixed INDOOR/OUTDOOR)
- **Tier 3 Premium** (3–4 Xu, VP 15–25, mostly INDOOR)
- **Tier 4 Luxury** (5–6 Xu, VP 35–45, INDOOR)
- **Culture & Action cards** — museums, historic sites, walks, rides
- **Utility cards** — ATMs, convenience stores, rest stops (virtual, no distance check)
